## 1.0.0

Original template projects by Raymond Law and Miguel Berrocal were reworked. Extra protocols were removed to make templates be closer to original Clean architecture concept. The result is ported to Objective-C as also.

- Added Swift and Objective-C versions of the **Scene** template to generate the following Clean architecture components:
	- View Controller
	- Interactor
	- Presenter
	- Router
	- Boundary Models
	- Configurator
- These components can also be generated individually.
